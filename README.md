# React_Login_Page
My first React project. This is a simple Login/ Register form. As it stands, it is hardcoded to show the page as if the user is not already registered, therefore you see Register button and a section to confirm the password.

However, the code also allows for it to be rendered as if the user was already registered. The Register button becomes a Login button, and the additional input for confirming the password disappears.
